    <dt>HIM Configuration Help</dt>
    <dd>This piece is a brief instruction manual I wrote for Oracle. The manual is for a cloud-based application that integrates the Optum web encoder with the Cerner Health Information Management (HIM) solution. This technology helps streamline the highly-regulated financial transactions between clinics and insurance companies. It also forms the backbone of an accurate electronic health record. The latest version of this document can be found on <a href="https://wiki.cerner.com/display/1101profileHP/HIM+Configuration+Help">CernerWiki</a>.</dd>

    <dt>From "Saint Didier's Flowering Verge..."</dt>
    <dd>This piece is an excerpt from peer reviewed article I wrote in collaboration with my research mentor, Virginia Blanton. The full text was origninally published in <a href="https://differentvisions.org/homage-to-medieval-langres/">Different Visions</a>, an open-access Art History journal supported by St. Olaf College and Oklahoma State University.
