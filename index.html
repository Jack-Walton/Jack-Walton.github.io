    <dt><a href="https://wiki.cerner.com/x/soogr">HIM Configuration Help</a></dt>
    <dd>A brief instruction manual that I wrote for Oracle Health. The manual is for a cloud-based application that integrates the Optum web encoder with the Cerner Health Information Management (HIM) solution. This technology helps streamline the highly-regulated financial transactions between clinics and insurance companies. It also forms the backbone of an accurate electronic health record. Subject-matter expertise was provided by the Cerner HIM product and engineering teams. Editorial guidance was prodived by my documentation architect. It is hosted on the Cerner Confluence instance, <a href="https://wiki.cerner.com">CernerWiki</a>.</dd>
