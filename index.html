        I wrote this piece, an academic User Experience (UX) literature review, as a graduate term paper for the University of Missouri. At the time, I was enrolled as a Libray and Information Science student. The paper received full marks from three peer reviewers and the professor. The document is hosted locally on this site, marked up in HTML and CSS.

    <dt><a href="https://wiki.cerner.com/x/soogr">HIM Configuration Help</a></dt>
    <dd>This piece is a brief instruction manual that I wrote for Oracle Health. The manual is for a cloud-based application that integrates the Optum web encoder with the Cerner Health Information Management (HIM) solution. This technology helps streamline the highly-regulated financial transactions between clinics and insurance companies. It also forms the backbone of an accurate electronic health record. Subject-matter expertise was provided by the Cerner HIM Product team, especially McKenzie Allen and Nate Konemann. Editorial guidance was prodived by my documentation architect, Ryan Bell. It is hosted on the Cerner Confluence instance, <a href="https://wiki.cerner.com">CernerWiki</a>.</dd>
